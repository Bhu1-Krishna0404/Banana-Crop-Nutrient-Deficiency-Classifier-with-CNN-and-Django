# Banana Crop Nutrient Deficiency Classifier with CNN and Django

## Description
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated into a Django web application to identify micro-nutrient deficiencies in banana crops by analyzing leaf images. The model aids in precision agriculture by providing accurate nutrient deficiency classification to improve crop health and yield.

## Proposed Algorithm
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Django==4.2.13
- TensorFlow==2.12.0
- Pillow==10.4.0

## Environment
- Python==3.9

## Features
- Upload banana leaf images via the web interface.
- Automatic detection and classification of nutrient deficiencies.
- Helps farmers and agronomists optimize nutrient management.
- User-friendly Django-based web app for easy accessibility.

## pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the Django server:
python manage.py runserver


## Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to use the app.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of banana leaf images showing various nutrient deficiency symptoms.
