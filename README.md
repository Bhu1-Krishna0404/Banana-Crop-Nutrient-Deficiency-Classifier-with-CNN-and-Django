# Banana-Crop-Nutrient-Deficiency-Classifier-with-CNN-and-Django
This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) integrated into a Django web application to identify micro-nutrient deficiencies in banana crops by analyzing leaf images. The model aids in precision agriculture by providing accurate nutrient deficiency classification to improve crop health and yield.
